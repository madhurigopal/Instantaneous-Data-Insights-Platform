Real-Time Analytics Hub Prototype
Overview
For businesses aiming to use data in real time for enhanced operational efficiency and decision-making, the Real-Time Analytics Centre provides an all-encompassing platform. An assortment of tools, algorithms to, and integrations have been stored in this repository to facilitate speedy analysis of streaming information and data analytics .

Features
•	Real-Time Data Processing: Utilize Apache Flink or Apache Spark for efficient and scalable real-time data processing.
•	Machine Learning Integration: Seamlessly integrate TensorFlow or Scikit-learn for predictive analytics and accurate data predictions.
•	Customizable Dashboard: Develop a user-friendly web-based dashboard using React.js or Vue.js, enabling customization and interactive data visualization.
•	Automated Actions: Implement Node.js or Python scripts for automated workflows triggered by predefined data conditions.
•	Scalable Infrastructure: Leverage Docker containers and Kubernetes for scalable and flexible infrastructure deployment.
•	Cloud Deployment: Deploy on Cloud Platforms (AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud) for scalability, flexibility, and efficient management.
•	Monitoring and Logging: Use Prometheus for monitoring and ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for logging, ensuring robust system health tracking.
